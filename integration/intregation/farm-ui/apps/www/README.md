## FarmUI

FarmUI is client first and animation rich ui component library built on top of
radix and shadcn as well other primitive providers that we would like to cover.

## Why FarmUI?

- Free and Paid Website template
- Styled and animated with framer motion built on top of radix and shadcn and
  wee will add more
- Framework agnostic only generic components
- Full block of components as copy and paste solution.

First, install the dependencies we highly recommend using pnpm, and run the
development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.
